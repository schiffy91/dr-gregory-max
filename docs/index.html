                <section class="clearfix">
                    <h3>The Humanist Integration</h3>
                    <p class="drop-cap">
                        True analysis extends beyond the clinical; it is an act of cultural and personal reclamation.
                        Dr. Max employs a deeply personalized approach to Object Relations Theory, utilizing the
                        humanities not merely as diversions, but as essential tools for self-realization and the
                        unlocking of one's ultimate potential.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Art & Projection</h4>
                    <p>
                        The visual arts serve as a mirror for the unconscious. By engaging with aesthetics, we access
                        parts of the psyche that resist verbalization, facilitating a deeper, non-linear reconstruction
                        of identity.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Music & Resonance</h4>
                    <p>
                        The mind possesses its own cadence. We attend to the "music" of the session—the tone, the
                        silence, the rhythm of speech—to tune the instrument of the self, harmonizing internal
                        dissonance.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Philosophy & Inquiry</h4>
                    <figure class="figure-float-right">
                        <img src="./assets/images/philosophy.jpg" alt="Bust of a philosopher">
                        <figcaption>The examined life.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Symptom reduction is merely the beginning; the goal is a thoughtful, examined life. We utilize
                        philosophical inquiry to confront existential anxieties and ethical dilemmas, clearing the path
                        toward authentic self-betterment.
                    </p>

                    <h4>History & Context</h4>
                    <p>
                        To know oneself is to know one's history. We situate personal struggles within the broader sweep
                        of human experience, finding dignity, meaning, and perspective in the continuity of the past.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Literature & Narrative</h4>
                    <figure class="figure-float-left">
                        <img src="./assets/images/office.jpg" alt="Stacks of classic literature">
                        <figcaption>Narratives that shape us.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        We engage with the great narratives to explore the internal scripts we unknowingly perform.
                        Through the lens of literature, we examine the "internal objects"—the internalized voices of the
                        past—that shape our present reality, allowing for a rewriting of the self.

                    <h3>The Physician</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Max is a distinguished alumnus of the accelerated 6-year BS/MD program, a rigorous
                        dual-degree curriculum at the City College of New York (CCNY, 1980) and Howard University
                        College of Medicine (Class of 1982).
                        With a career spanning over four decades, his practice stands as a bastion of classical medical
                        ethics. He offers a rare lens to modern healthcare: time, attention, and an unmediated
                        relationship between physician and patient, free from the intrusion of administrative and
                        insurance barriers.

                <p>
                    To protect the sanctity of the therapeutic relationship, this practice operates independently of

                    We prioritize the accessibility of end-to-end encrypted video consultations, which are never recorded.
                    To ensure absolute privacy, all clinical notes remain strictly analog—pen and paper—creating a private ledger accessible only to the physician.
